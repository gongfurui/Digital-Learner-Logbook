# COMP8830-DigitalLearnerLogbook
# Project Overview
# Project Context:
Based on the current research from the ACT government, the young and novice driver were facing casualty crash higher than that holding other types of driver licence from 2011 to 2015. ACT government wishes to present the new graduate licence schema (GLS) to the current system, which added the additional 120 supervised driving hours requirements into the learner logbook to issue a driver licence.
To deliver a qualitative and interactive learning process, we establish an app version of the learner logbook, which enables learners to practise driving skills by a professional instructor or by themselves.
# Project Necessity:
There is a paper-based logbook, which is currently used by the ACT government. However, it was no longer capable of carrying the new GLS. It means the paper-based logbook does not have an innovative method to contribute the driving hours and reflect leaner’s progress.
Our app is capable of enabling the learner to contribute driving hours through dual ways: fulfilling competency and self-practice, and tracking the progress automatically.
